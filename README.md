## How To Play

Hunt is an easy word search app. You can play with or without a timer, or in blitz mode, where you must find each individual word in a much smaller length of time.

If you are a graphic designer who can help with creating a better app icon, just create a pull request with whatever you have, I would really appreciate it :).

Help with translations for languages other than English would also be nice.
